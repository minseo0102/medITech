# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## `파일 개요 정리`

app.js가 로그인이야. 이게 메인임 -> 이거 디자인 요소는 index.html이랑 index.css임

## `각 html파일 역할`

insert.html -> 이게 환자 정보 입력
detail.html -> 환자 진료 정보 조회
submit.html -> 이게 action이랑 reward 출력하는 작은 팝업창

main.html -> 181~197번째 줄 (로그아웃 하는 부분이랑 의사 name 띄우는 부분 수정 ), 287번째 줄부터 보여주기식 그래프 코드
여기서 보여주기식 사진은 public에 medical-image1,2 사용하면 됨

main.css 도 수정햇으므로 이것도 그대로 복붙 바람!!! 안그럼 적용 안됨
